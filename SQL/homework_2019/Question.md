## Q2_UNCOMMON_TYPE
List the longest title of each type along with the runtime minutes

Find the titles which are the longest by runtime minutes. There might be cases where there is a tie for the longest titles - in that case return all of them. Display the types, primary titles and runtime minutes, and order it according to type (ascending) and use primary titles (ascending) as tie-breaker.


在title表中，根据type的不同，分别选出runtime minutes最大的元组(允许并列)列出其type、primary titles、runtime minutes，根据type对所有结果进行排序，primary titles作为排序的最终决断项。
